# Redux Feedback Loop


## Description
I created this project using React.js, Redux, and Node.js.

To run this application, you will need to fork and clone this repo.

Next, set up the PostgreSQL database. I used a Postico localhost for my project. The database name and SQL queries can be found in the data.sql file within my code.

This project is a series of forms that takes inputs. The first four pages will take in inputs that will save to the database you completed. The fifth page will allow you to view your previous answers. The last page will allow you to start over at the first page and leave new feedback!
